### The "Problem"

As you mus know, [Bootstrap tabs](https://mdbootstrap.com/components/tabs/) are very helpfull in projects that use it.
You can use it for master-detail thing, or just to present content to users. Anyway, it very simple to use... ***BUT***... There are little problems: 
* When the content of tabs are quite large.
* When are relations between the tabs.

*In the first one:* When the content are big and you scroll the page, the headers disappear. If the user want to click another TAB, he has to move up to see it.

*In the last one*: When we (programmers) use it (tabs) to make a master-detail thing, we have another issue. The scroll between the tabs are are always at the same. Let me exemplify, if you scroll down on the master tab, then, click on the detail tab and scroll up... when you get back to the master, you will be on the same position that you were on the detail. 

###### Okay, not so simple to explain, so, come on to better examples.
